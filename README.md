Short info about my apps

I am Aminob Bobur. I graduated from Tashkent University of Information Technology in 2024.

I have been in the field of programming for 4 years. The first programming language I learned is C++. I am currently a mobile programmer and I know Dart, Flutter. I have been working with Flutter for 2 years. During this time, I made several projects myself and also with the team.
